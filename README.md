The public directory contains the main index.html file that the Vue.js application is mounted on. The src directory contains the source code for the application. The api directory contains the code for the API calls. The assets directory contains static assets such as images. The components directory contains the Vue.js components for the different pages of the application. The router directory contains the Vue.js router configuration. The App.vue file is the root Vue.js component. The main.js file is the entry point for the application.

Authentication
The login system uses a simple username/password authentication mechanism. When a user logs in, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is returned from the server and stored in the browser's local storage. The token is used to authenticate API calls that require authentication.

API
The application uses a simple RESTful API to manage templates. The API has the following endpoints:

POST /api/login: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
GET /api/templates: Retrieves a list of templates.
POST /api/templates: Creates a new template.
GET /api/templates/:id: Retrieves a single template by ID.
PUT /api/templates/:id: Updates a template by ID.
DELETE /api/templates/:id: Deletes a template by ID.
Deployment
To deploy the application to a server, follow these steps:

Build the application by running npm run build. This will create a dist directory containing the built files.
Copy the contents of the dist directory to the server.
Set up a web server to serve the dist directory.
Configure the API endpoint URL in the api.js file to point to the correct URL.
